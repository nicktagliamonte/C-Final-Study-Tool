# Description
For Temple CIS 2107 Computer Systems and Low Level Programming, I am responsible for knowing the following:  
- hex arithmetic
- hex/binary conversion
- values for problems of the form 10^x where (3 | x) /\ (1 < x < 16)
- and approximate values for problems of the form 2^x where (10 | x) /\ (0 < x < 51)  

So I used time I could have been studying that to write a program which will ask me relevant questions about it
